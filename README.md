# Headspace Website Clone

I created a website clone of the famous meditation app, [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/).
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). <br>
It's a responsive website :iphone: and it includes [Dark Mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) :last_quarter_moon_with_face:.


## Libraries & Tools:
- [React JS](https://it.reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
- [React Icons](https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons)
- [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:  `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
